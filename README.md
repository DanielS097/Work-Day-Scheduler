### Work-Day-Scheduler

## What is this App?
This app is an event scheduler for a typical 9-5 job. 

## Who can use this app?
The app can be used by people who want to add events specifically for one working day.

## Can it be used in real life?
Ideally no, as this is just a basic event scheduler. However, if more work is put into it, it can serve the general public as well.

## What were the challenges faces when building this app?
The challenges that I faced with this app were in regards to the whole code and how to make it run smoothly and link it together. The CSS and HTML were a bit confusing, but ultimately with the help of my Tutor I managed to get the HTML right, together with the CSS.
Unfortunately my Font-Awesome didn't work, and the "save" button in my App is just a basic "save" button, but the code still works fine.

## How were the challenges overcome?
I overcame these challenges with help from my Tutor, but the JavaScript challenges were overcome by a lot of reasearch and new the discovery of new syntaxes, such as ".find" which is a method to search for
descendants elements that match a specified selector. I found it extremely helpful and used it in my code. I have also used a lot of help from people from coding communities.
