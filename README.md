# Work-Day-Scheduler

## What is this App?
This app is an event scheduler for a typical 9-5 job. 

## Who can use this app?
The app can be used by people who want to add events specifically for one working day.

## Can it be used in real life?
Ideally no, as this is just a basic event scheduler. However, if more work is put into it, it can serve the general public as well.

## What were the challenges faces when building this app?
The challenges that I faced with this app were in regards to the whole code and how to make it run smoothly and link it together. The CSS and HTML were a bit confusing, but ultimately with the help of my Tutor I managed to get the HTML right, together with the CSS.
Unfortunately my Font-Awesome didn't work, and the "save" button in my App is just a basic "save" button, but the code still works fine.

## How were the challenges overcome?
I overcame these challenges with help from my Tutor, but the JavaScript challenges were overcome by a lot of reasearch and new the discovery of new syntaxes, such as ".find" which is a method to search for
descendants elements that match a specified selector. I found it extremely helpful and used it in my code. I have also used a lot of help from people from coding communities. 

## What did I learn from building this app?
I have learned a lot building this app and how local storage can be used. I admit that I have trouble remembering how to use it and I spent a lot of time googling and going back to the lessons to understand the 
principle. I am constantly learning that I need to have a lot of patience and that I must master the fundamentals of coding if I want to succeed. There are a lot of easy ways and paths to take, but I would
much rather take the slightly more complicated ones so I can lear more in the process of bulding something. I still feel overwhelmed from time to time and I find it hard to remember so many things and
I feel like an imposter. But I guess that comes with the Developer job. I still feel that I have a long way to master the fundamentals; especially JavaScript which still gives me a hard time. I am looking forward to the day where I won't need that much help with it.
